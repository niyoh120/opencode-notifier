# Plan: Analyze issue 25 and bun.report crash

## Goal
- Determine whether issue 25’s crash is likely caused by the plugin or by Bun itself.
- Provide a concise, evidence-based response to the user.

## Current evidence
- Issue 25 says OpenCode crashes on Windows 10 after installing plugin; user suspects sound playback.
- bun.report stack trace shows segmentation fault in Bun’s shell interpreter finalizer/GC (`interpreter.zig`, WebKit JSC heap) and indicates “bug in Bun, not your code.”
- The crash report is for Bun v1.3.5 on Windows x86_64.

## Plan steps
1. Read issue 25 details via `gh issue view 25` (already done) and summarize the user’s repro notes.
2. Fetch bun.report details (if available) and extract call stack highlights and runtime info.
3. Cross-reference plugin code to see if it uses Bun shell APIs or audio playback/native bindings.
4. Provide a conclusion based on evidence:
   - If stack trace is only in Bun runtime/GC, classify as Bun runtime crash, possibly triggered by plugin behavior (sound playback).
   - If plugin uses native audio bindings or Bun shell features, note these as likely triggers, but not proof of plugin bug.
5. Recommend next diagnostic steps: reproduce with plugin disabled, then with sound disabled, and test on latest Bun version.

## Files/areas to inspect
- `src/` plugin entry points and activation code
- audio or sound playback modules under `src/` or `sounds/`
- `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` for notes about audio and Bun compatibility

## Verification
- Open bun.report link and ensure stack trace details match the reported crash.
- Confirm whether plugin audio playback uses Bun shell or native modules.
